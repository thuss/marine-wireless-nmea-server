= Marine Wireless NMEA Server

This tiny embedded NMEA server reads and writes NMEA 0183 on a serial port and makes it available via wireless 802.11.

= TODO 

* Add NMEA 2000 support
* Improve the documentation for running the 

= Explanation

This is the code that shipped on the Marine Marines Navigation Server http://marinewireless.us 

It is designed to run in a very small memory footprint on a Java 1.4 JRE (but it may work on newer JRE's as well). The first Marine Wireless Server was an embedded Soekris board with 32MB of ram which is more than enough to run a small Linux distribution and small Java virtual machine. The server has been tested and used with both the Sun JRE and other JRE's like Kaffe. The server works on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

= Usage

To run the server using using the included sample NMEA file for testing:

cd marine-wireless-nmea-server
export CLASSPATH=lib/mwserver.jar:lib/log4j-1.2.8.jar:lib/kxml.jar 
java mw.server.Server -f etc/config.xml
telnet localhost 8000

To get it to read/write to the serial port where your NMEA Mux is connected you'll want to edit config.xml and comment out the NMEAFromFile mediator and uncomment either the NMEAonCOM1 (Windows) or NMEAonDevTTYS0 (Linux) mediator. Be sure to adjust the baudrate as well.

Also see etc/mwserver.initd for an example of an init.d script to start the software at boot time.
